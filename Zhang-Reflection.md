**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was really struggling with uploading my screenshot to the repo because I forgot that Cloud9 work slightly different than Git. But, my partner, Dave, help me along the way and I was able to figured it out. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I was confused with the fetch and merge concepts but my partner, Dave, and our guide explained it to me. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked them about the fetch and merge concepts. I also asked my guide how to be a good navigator since it was my very first time being one. I asked my pair how to upload images to Gitbecause I was pretty lose with Cloud9 but once it was figured out, it was very easy.

**What still confuses you about git?**
To be honest, I don't think there's anything I'm confused about Git now. The only thing I'm confuse is using Cloud9 under Git instructions. I mentioned this before, Cloud9 basically works the same as Git but since Cloud9 is a online program, some of the functions do work differently. This give me confusion sometime such as the uploading the screenshot incident. My partner was trying his best to teach me through Git instruction but I was very lost since I'm using Cloud9. Eventually, I got it figured it out but it will be nice to instruction for Cloud9 too. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was great! Both my guide and pair was very patient with my questions and helping me as much as they could. My pair and I worked really well together and it was a good experience having a guide looking at our work to make sure that we were on the right track. All I can say is I enjoyed it!
