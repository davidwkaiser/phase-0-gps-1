**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
no concepts, just an overall discomfort using git, tracking things has been difficult for me, so I worry I'm going to break or lose something. I expect to love git someday, but I still fear it now

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
merge conflict, and how to recover from it. That was helpful

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
how to work well together, some technical questions or clarifying questions about our flow.

**What still confuses you about git?**
see above, not so much confusion, as discomfort. I understand how to create a branch, make changes, commit, push, merge, etc, but it still freaks me out.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Really frustrating. there was one point where my partner was struggling to get something, and I was explaining it poorly, so we went round and round for a bit. It was also difficult to read when one of the others was talking. I will have to mention that I may need to mute when I need to read. It really hurt my head to read while others were talking.
